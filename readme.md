# Greek Computer Solution

I was gifted a "Greek Computer" puzzle that I gave up trying to solve manually and brute forced the solution to it with this code.

The puzzle consists of 5 overlapping discs that are stacked on top of each other with differing number of rows and gaps creating different values displayed depending on the discs rotations.

I converted these discs into a series of rows and columns. The puzzle is solved when the columns are aligned in such a way that the sum of all displayed numbers in all columns is 42.
